# Frontend Mentor - IP address tracker

![Design preview for the IP address tracker coding challenge](./design/desktop-preview.jpg)

## Project Log
I was just looking for something interesting for me in Frontend Mentor, and then i saw this!
Since this challenge was related to using APIs, i was intrigued!
The UI was simple, but i enjoy using two different API and make this magic happen ^_^
I've learned a lot of stuff and i'm tryin to write cleaner code (Of course in this little project there is no confusion since its just 50 lines of code, but it's a good practice).
* Only issue was to Rerender the map when user wants to try another domain or ip address, and i manage to do it successfully.
